Declarative state machines for Storable lifecycle management.

Three tiers of side-effects on each Transition:

  Tier 1 — action:         Runs inside DB transaction, atomic with state change.
  Tier 2 — on_enter/on_exit: Fire-and-forget after commit.
  Tier 3 — start_workflow: Durable workflow via WorkflowEngine after commit.
